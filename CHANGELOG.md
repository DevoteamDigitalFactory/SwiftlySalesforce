# Change Log

## Version 3.5.2 (Jun. 17, 2017)
Updated the default Salesforce API version to 40.0 (Summer '17)

## Version 3.5.1 (Jun. 7, 2017)
Fixes [issue #29](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/29).

## Version 3.5.0 (Apr. 26, 2017)
- Updated the default Salesforce API version to 39.0 (Spring '17).
- Added method `Salesforce.describeAll()` to retrieve metadata about all objects defined in the org ([issue #28](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/28)).
- Bug fix; `ObjectDescription.keyPrefix` now returns an empty string if the retrieved object metadata value is null. (In the next major release `keyPrefix` will become an optional string.) ([issue #36](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/36))
- `ObjectDescription.fields` now returns an empty dictionary if the retrieved metadata has no field-level information, as is the case with `Salesforce.describeAll()`. (In the next major release, `fields` will become an optional dictionary.)
- Bug fix; `Salesforce.limits()` broke with the Salesforce Spring '17 release, which changed the JSON payload returned by the REST API's `limits` resource ([issue #37](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/37)).
- `Model.UserInfo` and `Model.QueryResult` now have public initializers ([issue #34](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/34)).

## Version 3.4.0 (Feb. 26, 2017)

## Version 3.2.0 (Dec. 14, 2016)
- Added Salesforce.describe( ) method, and corresponding [model](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/Pod/Classes/Model.swift) structs (ObjectDescription, FieldDescription, PicklistValue) for retrieving [object metadata](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_describe.htm). (Closes [issue #13](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/13).)

## Version 3.1.1 (Nov. 23, 2016)
Fixed issue #15; removed unneeded `id` parameter in `Salesforce.insert( )` method

## Version 3.1.0 (Nov. 16, 2016)
- Updated `LoginDelegate` to accommodate custom login view controllers and flows. Note: the default [OAuth2 user-agent flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_user_agent_oauth_flow.htm) with the Salesforce-hosted webform is the recommended way to authenticate users; your app shouldn't handle their credentials. Adapted from [@hmuronaka's pull request](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/pull/14).
- Deprecated `LoginDelegate` extension method `handleRedirectURL(redirectURL: URL)` in favor of `handleRedirectURL(url: URL)`.

## Version 3.0.1 (Oct. 27, 2016)
Added file "OAuth2.plist" which is used for testing the framework. If you run the tests, edit the file and insert your own values for the Salesforce access token, refresh token, etc.

- Upgrade for Swift 3
- Lots of enhancements to make building native iOS apps on Salesforce even easier - see the [README](./README.md)

## Version 2.2.0 (Oct. 24, 2016)
